# Dynamic Blog Project
 This project is made by using ASP.NET CORE MVC, but it isn't completed yet. 
 In this project, I have used Layer Architecture. So, it consists of Business Layer, DataAccess Layer, Entity Layer, and Presentation Layer. The main idea here is to build a dynamic blog that has many features to provide a good experience for users. In addition, you can see the result after one month from now, so don't forget to return back to start using it.

##### To run this project you need only to have [vs](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)/[vsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) on your laptop and life will be fun with you.
